Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have made good progress with my swift project, I have been able to implement photo filters, as well as an option to import pictures from iPhone library OR take it on the spot with the Camera option.  

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have to implement some designs and also a few small changes to the look and feel of it. I have to improve the user interface to make it look more appealing. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I have had a few problems like for example, the CoreImage library was not responding with my snippets of code, it took a greater part of my time and energy in fixing it. Thanks to Harvard CS50x and a bit of StackOverflow I was able to solve the problem. Secondly the orientation of my app was not matching with how it would look on the iPhone. Thankfully both these problems were solved.
