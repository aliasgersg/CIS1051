# FilterGood (iOS/Swift)

Image filtering app in Swift. Implemented basic colour filters.

## Why FilterGood?
My first thoughts about Swift were not positive, I was anxious in learning a whole new programming language. I was planning to stick to Python but I thought about learning something new along with my Final Project. After spending a few weeks coding in Swift, I look back to how wrong I was. I'm really happy to have pursued this project because I've been able to learn a very powerful language and also have been able to take up a new skill. 

After several hours of brainstorming and making plans, I finally decided on doing something related to Image filtering. Swift has limitless possibilities but the most fascinating library (based on my skill level) was the CoreImage library it has a diverse range of functions and I was excited to play with this library. 

## Problems

I had a few problems like for example, the CoreImage library was not responding with my snippets of code, it took a greater part of my time and energy in fixing it. Thanks to Harvard CS50x and a bit of StackOverflow I was able to solve the problem. Secondly the orientation of my app was not matching with how it would look on the iPhone. Thankfully both these problems were solved.

## Features that didn't make the cut 

I was not able to implement a 'Hold to save image' function since it was an arduous task because upon implementation it would destroy the entire orientation of the app and at a few simulations it even crashed my app. 

## Future plans

After exams get over, in the holidays I plan to work on this project and strive to improve it. I've had a couple ideas like implementing categories for further enhancement like: blur effects, cartoon, infra-red and etc. CoreImage is a huge library and I aim to explore every part of it.
