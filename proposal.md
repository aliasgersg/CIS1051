# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Filter Good

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An image filter made using SwiftUI.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project consists of a user uploading their photo and then make changes or apply filters to their photos.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Personal project.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will challenge myself with Swift and learn new different libraries that come with it.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I will have applied my knowledge of SwiftUI, which I learned from Harvards CS50 course as well as the basic programming concepts I have learned and applied in 1051.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to have learned the key components of SwiftUI aswell as master the use of methods and class.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

/* I will need to explore the CoreImage library made for Swift.
/* I will look at some apps published on the AppStore and aim for creating a new filter/feature, something that can differentiate from the other apps.
