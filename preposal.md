# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project

My plan is to pursue the iOS track and build an app using Swift. I'm still exploring my options but what I plan to make is a To-Do list app that comes integrated with a timer aswell. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I plan to do by myself

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Explore and research the possibility of integrating more things into the app.
